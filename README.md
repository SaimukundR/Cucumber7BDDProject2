Selenium Cucumber BDD Automation Project
This project demonstrates the automation of web applications using Selenium WebDriver integrated with Cucumber BDD for behavior-driven testing. The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, uses TestNG for test execution, and is integrated with Jenkins for continuous integration.

Key Features
Selenium WebDriver: Automates web browsers for functional testing.
Cucumber BDD: Write test scenarios in plain English using Gherkin syntax.
Page Object Model (POM): Ensures separation of test logic from UI interactions.
TestNG Integration: Manages test execution and reporting.
Jenkins Integration: Continuous integration for automated builds and test execution.
WebDriverManager: Automatically manages browser drivers.
Maven: Handles project dependencies and build automation.
Tools & Technologies Used
Java: Programming language for writing test scripts.
Selenium WebDriver: Browser automation framework.
Cucumber: BDD framework for writing readable test cases.
TestNG: Testing framework for organizing and executing tests.
Maven: Build automation tool for managing dependencies.
WebDriverManager: Manages browser drivers.
Jenkins: Continuous integration server.

Jenkins (for CI/CD integration)
Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SeleniumCucumberBDDProject.git
Install Dependencies: Run the following command to download and install required dependencies:

bash

Jenkins Integration
This project is integrated with Jenkins for continuous integration and automated test execution. Follow these steps to set up Jenkins:

Install Maven and JDK on the Jenkins server.
Configure a Jenkins job by selecting "Maven Project" and providing the repository URL.
Add the following steps in the Jenkinsfile for build and test automation:
groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/YourUsername/SeleniumCucumberBDDProject.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
    }
}
Configure triggers for automatic build and test execution on code changes.
Project Features
1. Cucumber BDD Integration
Cucumber is used to write behavior-driven tests in plain English using Gherkin syntax. Here's a sample feature file for login:

gherkin
Copy code
Feature: Login Feature

  Scenario: User logs in with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters a valid username and password
    And clicks on the login button
    Then the user should be logged in successfully
2. Selenium WebDriver
The WebDriver handles browser automation, interacting with web elements such as input fields, buttons, and links.

3. Page Object Model (POM)
The POM design pattern is implemented to maintain cleaner and reusable code. Each web page has its own corresponding class with locators and methods for interacting with the page.

4. TestNG & Reports
Test execution is managed using TestNG which also generates detailed reports. TestNG provides the flexibility to execute test suites, groups, and individual tests.

5. Jenkins Integration
Jenkins automates build and test processes, ensuring continuous integration. Every code change is built, tested, and reported through Jenkins.
